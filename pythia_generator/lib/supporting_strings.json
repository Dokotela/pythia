Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines (including flu and RSV) on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tFor people who have a history of myocarditis with MIS-C or MIS-A, see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tYes\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t1\tn/a\t5 years\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines (including flu and RSV) on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tFor people who have a history of myocarditis with MIS-C or MIS-A, see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t2\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines (including flu and RSV) on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tFor people who have a history of myocarditis with MIS-C or MIS-A, see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t3\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing.

Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines (including flu and RSV) on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tFor people who have a history of myocarditis with MIS-C or MIS-A, see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t6\tn/a\t5 years\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\t7 years\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines (including flu and RSV) on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tFor people who have a history of myocarditis with MIS-C or MIS-A, see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t7\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t5 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines (including flu and RSV) on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tFor people who have a history of myocarditis with MIS-C or MIS-A, see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tNo\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t8\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Clinical trial participants who did not receive all the recommended doses, or who received other vaccines not listed above, should consult with their healthcare provider to determine if they should receive an FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine series.\nAdministrative Guidance\tA patients clinical team is best positioned to determine the degree of immune compromise and appropriate timing of vaccination.\n\nFactors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include disease severity, duration, clinical stability, complications, comorbidities, and any potentially immune-suppressing treatment.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have the option to receive 1 additional dose of updated (2023-2024 formula) mRNA vaccine. Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tCOVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines (including flu and RSV) on the same day. People, particularly adolescent or young male adults, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvius vaccination.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPeople ages 18 years and older who completed primary vaccination using any COVID-19 vaccine and have not received any previous booster dose(s) may receive a monovalent Novavax booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series if they are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose.\nAdministrative Guidance\tFor people who have a history of myocarditis with MIS-C or MIS-A, see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t9\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tRecipient of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (004)\tAdminister to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] within 2 years of successful transplantation.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tB-lymphocyte [humoral] - Severe antibody deficiencies (145)\tAdminister to persons who have severe B-lymphocyte (humoral) - antibody deficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Complete defects (147)\tAdminister to persons who have complete cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] disease, complete DiGeorge syndrome).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tT-lymphocyte [cell-mediated and humoral] - Partial defects (148)\tAdminister to persons who have partial cell-mediated or humoral T-lymphocyte defects (e.g., most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia- telangiectasia).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tPhagocytic function - Leukocyte adhesion defect, and myeloperoxidase deficiency (153)\tAdminister to persons who have a phagocytic function defect (e.g. leukocyte adhesion defect and myeloperoxidase deficiency).\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tHIV/AIDS - Severely immunocompromised (154)\tAdminister to persons who have HIV/AIDS and are severely immunocompromised [See the CDC general recommendations for a definition of \"severely immunocompromised\"].\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tTransplantation (157)\tAdminister to persons who have received a transplant.\t6 months\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tImmunosuppressive therapy (158)\tAdminister to persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Previously, the supporting data would recommend a dose at 7 AND at 11 in certain situations.  This allows for skipping the 11 year recommendation if the child is recommended and receives dose(s) between 7 through 10 years.  Either dose 8 or 9 must be satisfied, but not both.\nChange\t3\tInterval on Dose 9\tInterval was specified\tRemoved Interval on 11 year Adolescent dose\tA child who is \"fully vaccinated\" for DTaP by age 7 years is to be recommended for Tdap at age 11 years without regard to interval.  Similarly, the adolescent dose of Tdap can be administered without regard to interval from the last DTaP dose.  This is not the case, however, when the child enters age 7 years and is not fully vaccinated for DTaP and this is addressed in dose 6, 7, and 8 (catch-up doses) in the series.\nChange\t4\tDose 10\tNot Specified in previous version.\tDose 10 added\tPreviously Dose 9 was the adolescent dose as well as the recurring 10 year booster dose.  These two requirements were separated into two different doses. Dose 9 is now the adolescent dose and Dose 10 is the recurring 10 year booster.\n\nVersion\t1.2\nChange\tChange #\tArea\tPrevious \tChange\tReason for Change\nChange\t1\tLatest Recommended Interval on Dose 9\tN/A\t10 years + 4 weeks\tBased on clarification from NIPInfo.\n\nVersion\t1.1\nChange\tChange #\tArea\tPrevious \tChange\tReason for Change\nChange\t1\tGeneral Updates\tN/A\tAdded \"Overview\" section to Overview tab.

This was missing in version 1.0 and forcing the child through the catch-up doses.\nChange\t4\tCatch-up Doses 6 - 8 Latest Recommended Age and Latest Recommended Intervals\tValues not specified\tAdded Latest Recommended Age and Latest Recommended Intervals to match the Earliest Recommended Age and Earliest Recommended Intervals for each dose.\tThese were empty before which resulted in a forecast with no Past Due Date.  Since the child is in catch-up at this point, the Past Due Date should align with the Recommended Date.\nChange\t5\tAge Values on Dose 9\tValues not specified\tAbsolute Minimum Age: 7 years Minimum Age: 11 Years Earliest Recommended Age: 11 Years Latest Recommended Age: 13 Years\tThere were no age values on the recurring dose which resulted in the 11 year dose for a child who was up-to-date with

Doesn't that mean that an individual could complete the Twinrix series without getting any doses of Twinrix?\tYes, a subject matter expert at the CDC confirmed that an individual would be considered fully protected with 3 doses of HepA single antigen vaccine on the Twinrix schedule. Because this schedule is intended for use with Twinrix, we have elected to keep the tradename in the series name.\tn/a\tHepA is allowable for all 3 doses in the Twinrix 3-dose series.\nFAQs\tIn the 2-dose series, the Preferable Interval and Allowable Interval look suspiciously like the same thing, why are both necessary?\tThe Preferable Interval is 6 months from the immediately previous dose which may be invalid if an attempted second dose was administered before 6 months. However the April 2017 ACIP Best Practice Guidelines notes an administration pattern where if the last dose is separated by 6 months from the 1st dose, Hep A can be considered complete. The Allowable Interval accounts for this possibility.\thttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html\tBoth the Preferable and Allowable interval is populated for dose 2 of a 2-dose series.\nFAQs\tIn the Risk 2-dose series why are CVX codes 83 and 104 allowable for the first dose but not the second dose?\tDoses of CVX 83 and 104 contain a lower dose of antigen which is only valid for persons under the age of 19 years. The 2-dose risk series for adults only, but if a patient received one dose before the age of 19 years it still counts towards completion of the first dose of the series.

Patients and staff members who do not respond to the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated with three additional doses and retested for response. No additional series should be administered (i.e., a 3rd full series). The patient should receive yearly boosters starting 1 year after completion of the second series.\nAdministrative Guidance\tRetest patients who respond to the vaccine annually for anti-HBs. If anti-HBs declines to less than 10 mIU/mL, administer a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and continue to retest annually. Retesting immediately after the booster dose is not necessary. For staff members who respond to the vaccine, booster doses of vaccine are not necessary, and periodic serologic testing to monitor antibody concentrations is not recommended\nAdministrative Guidance\tRoutine childhood vaccination against hepatitis B has been recommended since 1991 and routine adolescent vaccination since 1995. Thus, many persons who develop end-stage renal failure will have a history of vaccination against hepatitis B. These persons should have responded to the vaccine when their immune status was normal, but if their anti-HBs levels are less than 10 mIU/mL when they begin dialysis, they should be revaccinated with a complete primary series.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tYes\tNo\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t1\t20 years\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tDialysis patient (032)\tAdminister to hemodialysis patients and predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home dialysis patients\t20 years\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t0 days\t20 years\t20 years\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

Patients and staff members who do not respond to the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated with three additional doses and retested for response. No additional series should be administered (i.e., a 3rd full series). The patient should receive yearly boosters starting 1 year after completion of the second series.\nAdministrative Guidance\tRetest patients who respond to the vaccine annually for anti-HBs. If anti-HBs declines to less than 10 mIU/mL, administer a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and continue to retest annually. Retesting immediately after the booster dose is not necessary. For staff members who respond to the vaccine, booster doses of vaccine are not necessary, and periodic serologic testing to monitor antibody concentrations is not recommended\nAdministrative Guidance\tRoutine childhood vaccination against hepatitis B has been recommended since 1991 and routine adolescent vaccination since 1995. Thus, many persons who develop end-stage renal failure will have a history of vaccination against hepatitis B. These persons should have responded to the vaccine when their immune status was normal, but if their anti-HBs levels are less than 10 mIU/mL when they begin dialysis, they should be revaccinated with a complete primary series.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tYes\tIncreased Risk\t2\tA\t2\t20 years\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tDialysis patient (032) \tAdminister to hemodialysis patients and predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home dialysis patients\t20 years\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t0 days\t20 years\t20 years\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

If the patient is younger than age 7 years when the primary series is completed, then the first booster dose should be given with a 3 year interval followed by boosters every 5 years afterwards. If the patient is over the age of 7 years when the primary series is completed, then the first booster should be given with a 5 year interval and every 5 years afterwards.\thttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/mening.html\tThe second to last dose has an interval of 3 years and Conditional Skip logic that allows the dose to be skipped if the primary series was completed after the age of 7 years. Because only a single booster dose with a 3 year interval is required, this dose is not marked as a Recurring Dose. The final dose is a recurring dose with an interval of 5 years.\n","immunity":"Clinical History Immunity\tImmunity Guideline\nClinical History Immunity\tn/a\n\nBirth Date Immunity\tImmunity Birth Date\tImmunity Country of Birth\tImmunity Exclusion Condition\nBirth Date Immunity\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n","contraindications":"Antigen Contraindication\tContraindication (Code)\tText Description\tAdministrative Guidance\tContraindication Begin Age\tContraindication End Age (less than)\nAntigen Contraindication\tSevere allergic reaction after previous dose of Meningococcal (095)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of Meningococcal vaccine.\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nAntigen Contraindication\tAdverse reaction to vaccine component (080)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had an adverse reaction to a vaccine component.\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nVaccine Contraindication\tContraindication (Code)\tText Description\tAdministrative Guidance\tVaccine Type (CVX)\tContraindication Begin Age\tContraindication End Age (less than)\nVaccine Contraindication\tSevere allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid (117)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had a severe allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid.\tn/a\tMeningococcal, MCV4O (136)\tn/a\tn/a\nVaccine Contraindication\tSevere allergic reaction to tetanus toxoid (118)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had a severe allergic reaction to tetanus toxoid.\tn/a\tMeningococcal Polysaccharide A, C, Y, W-135 TT Conjugate (203)\tn/a\tn/a\nVaccine Contraindication\tSevere allergic reaction to tetanus toxoid (118)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had a severe allergic reaction to tetanus toxoid.\tn/a\tmeningococcal polysaccharide (MenACWY-TT conjugate), (MenB), PF (316)\tn/a\tn/a\n","series":["Series Name\tMeningococcal ACWY 2-dose series\nTarget Disease\tMeningococcal\nVaccine Group\tMeningococcal\nAdministrative Guidance\tText\nAdministrative Guidance\tPenbraya (MenABCWY - Pfizer) may be used when both MenACWY and MenB are indicated at the same visit.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\t2\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tYes\tNo\tStandard\t1\tA\t1\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t10 years\t11 years\t11 years\t13 years + 4 weeks\t19 years\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

Persons who transition to receiving JYNNEOS boosters are expected to continue receiving JYNNEOS boosters and to not revert to ACAM2000; in addition, the frequency of booster doses should correspond to the vaccine used for boosters. For example, persons who previously received ACAM2000 every 3 years because of work with more virulent orthopoxviruses might decide to change to JYNNEOS when their next booster dose is due; in these cases, subsequent JYNNEOS booster doses should be administered every 2 years.\nAdministrative Guidance\tEvidence of a take is often used as a marker of successful vaccination after ACAM2000. Because JYNNEOS is a replication-deficient vaccine, vaccination with JYNNEOS does not produce a take\nAdministrative Guidance\tWhen vaccination is used for prevention of mpox in persons with HIV infection, JYNNEOS is preferred over ACAM2000.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tRisk\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tNo\tIncreased Risk\t1\tA\t1\t18 years\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tResearch laboratory personnel working with more virulent orthopoxviruses (e.g., Variola virus or mpox virus) (232)\tAdminister to research laboratory personnel working with more virulent orthopoxviruses (e.g., Variola virus or mpox virus)\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tClinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for more virulent orthopoxviruses (e.g., Variola virus or mpox virus) (233)\tAdminister to clinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for more virulent orthopoxviruses (e.g., Variola virus or mpox virus)\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tDesignated response team members working with more virulent orthopoxviruses (e.g., Variola virus or mpox virus) (234)\tAdminister to designated response team members working with more virulent orthopoxviruses (e.g., Variola virus or mpox virus)\t18 years\tn/a\tBooster doses are     recommended for response personnel only once an event is identified.\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t1 year - 4 days\t18 years\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

Proper documentation of which OPV vaccine was received is critical to validation of records against U.S. vaccination recommendations.\nAdministrative Guidance\tPersons who received 4 doses of IPV before August 7, 2009 can be considered fully vaccinated for polio, regardless of age of the last dose, and it is not necessary to routinely administer an additional dose for these persons. If they are at increased risk of poliovirus exposure, they should be offered a single lifetime booster dose of IPV.\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\tn/a\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tNo\tNo\tStandard\t1\tA\t2\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t6 weeks - 4 days\t6 weeks\t2 months\t3 months + 4 weeks\t18 years\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

Previously, the supporting data would recommend a dose at 7 AND at 11 in certain situations.  This allows for skipping the 11 year recommendation if the child is recommended and receives dose(s) between 7 through 10 years.  Either dose 8 or 9 must be satisfied, but not both.\nChange\t3\tInterval on Dose 9\tInterval was specified\tRemoved Interval on 11 year Adolescent dose\tA child who is \"fully vaccinated\" for DTaP by age 7 years is to be recommended for Tdap at age 11 years without regard to interval.  Similarly, the adolescent dose of Tdap can be administered without regard to interval from the last DTaP dose.  This is not the case, however, when the child enters age 7 years and is not fully vaccinated for DTaP and this is addressed in dose 6, 7, and 8 (catch-up doses) in the series.\nChange\t4\tDose 10\tNot Specified in previous version.\tDose 10 added\tPreviously Dose 9 was the adolescent dose as well as the recurring 10 year booster dose.

This was missing in version 1.0 and forcing the child through the catch-up doses.\nChange\t4\tCatch-up Doses 6 - 8 Latest Recommended Age and Latest Recommended Intervals\tValues not specified\tAdded Latest Recommended Age and Latest Recommended Intervals to match the Earliest Recommended Age and Earliest Recommended Intervals for each dose.\tThese were empty before which resulted in a forecast with no Past Due Date.

This is an unlikely scenario as administering ZVL after RZV is not a recommended administration pattern. The two intervals help ensure proper spacing for both evaluation and forecasting of RZV doses when ZVL is intermingled. The ZVL dose would be considered invalid following an RZV regardless of spacing. \tn/a\t2 intervals on Dose 2 of the 2-dose series to ensure the second dose of RZV is properly spaced from the first dose of RZV and a possible ZVL administration.\n","immunity":"Clinical History Immunity\tImmunity Guideline\nClinical History Immunity\tn/a\n\nBirth Date Immunity\tImmunity Birth Date\tImmunity Country of Birth\tImmunity Exclusion Condition\nBirth Date Immunity\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n","contraindications":"Antigen Contraindication\tContraindication (Code)\tText Description\tAdministrative Guidance\tContraindication Begin Age\tContraindication End Age (less than)\nAntigen Contraindication\tAdverse reaction to vaccine component (080)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had an adverse reaction to a vaccine component.\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nVaccine Contraindication\tContraindication (Code)\tText Description\tAdministrative Guidance\tVaccine Type (CVX)\tContraindication Begin Age\tContraindication End Age (less than)\nVaccine Contraindication\tSevere allergic reaction after previous dose of recombinant zoster (172)\tDo not vaccinate if the patient has had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of recombinant zoster vaccine.\tn/a\tZoster recombinant (187)\tn/a\tn/a\n","series":["Series Name\tZoster 2-dose series\nTarget Disease\tZoster\nVaccine Group\tZoster \nAdministrative Guidance\tText\nAdministrative Guidance\tn/a\nSeries Type\tType\nSeries Type\tStandard\nEquivalent Series Groups\tSeries Groups\nEquivalent Series Groups\t2\nGender\tRequired Gender\nGender\tn/a\nSelect Patient Series\tDefault Series\tProduct Path\tSeries Group Name\tSeries Group\tSeries Priority\tSeries Preference\tMinimum Age To Start\tMaximum Age To Start\nSelect Patient Series\tYes\tNo\tStandard\t1\tA\t1\tn/a\tn/a\nIndication\tObservation (Code)\tText Description\tIndication Begin Age\tIndication End Age (less than)\tAdministrative Guidance\nIndication\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n\nSeries Dose\tDose 1\nAge\tAbsolute Minimum Age\tMinimum Age\tEarliest Recommended Age\tLatest Recommended Age (less than)\tMaximum Age (less than)\tEffective Date\tCessation Date\nAge\t18 years\t50 years\t50 years\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\nPreferable Interval\tFrom Immediate Previous Dose Administered?

For example, persons who previously received ACAM2000 every 3 years because of work with more virulent orthopoxviruses might decide to change to JYNNEOS when their next booster is due; in these cases, subsequent JYNNEOS booster doses should be administered every 2 years. \tVaccinia\t44725\tAll Valid: Forecast Test\t44721\t\tRecommended based on interval\t\t4.4\n2022-0035\tPatient is a clinical laboratory worker working with less virulent orthopoxivirus and has received two doses of the Orthopox vaccine\t31233\tM\t237\tClinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for less virulent othropoxviruses (e.g., Vaccinia virus or Cowpox viurs)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot Complete\t44507\tvaccinia - smallpox \t206\tBN\tValid\trisk\t\t44698\tVaccinia-smallpox\t206\tBN\tValid\trisk\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t48351\t48351\t\t\tVaccinia\t44698\tAll Valid: Forecast Test\t44839\t\tRecommended based on Condition\t\t4.4\n2022-0036\tPatient is 16 months of age and is receiving active treatment for solid tumors and has not received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\t44289\tF\t189\tActive treatement for solid tumors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot Complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t44472\t44472\t\tCovid-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing.
