# Logical Specification Concepts

There are a number of concepts that are involved in the evaluation and prediction of immunizations. Some of these terms make logical sense, but others do not. Here's a description of some of them. Again, this was all taken from the [Clinical Decision Support for Immunization (CDSi)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/cdsi.html).

## Target Dose

#### A TargetDose is said to be 'unsatisfied' until a dose matches all of its required criteria. At that time, the TargetDose is incremented by one. Below is a basic example from the CDC

How a Vaccine Dose Administered Satisfies a Target Dose - TODO (add image)

- Target dose - this is a term that makes some intrinsic sense, and then has been used in confusing ways, at least I thought so. The target dose is the next recommended dose in a series. When we evaluate past vaccines, we check to see if a particular vaccine that was given meets the requirements of the target dose. If it is, that target dose is considered complete, and we move onto the next target dose.

#### *As a side note, anytime you see the term 'Vaccine Dose Administered' replace it with 'Dose Given', and it makes much more sense

### Statuses

        <tr>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Extraneous</td>
            <td>Meaning the dose doesn't count towards the series, but doesn't need to be repeated (including maximum age and extra doses)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Not Valid</td>
            <td>Not administered according to ACIP recommendations, does not count towards the series, will need to be repeated</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Sub-standard</td>
            <td>Dose had a condition (e.g., expired, sub-potent, and recall) making it invalid, will need to be repeated</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

### Selecting Supporting Data

        </tr>

</div>


### Date Calculations

As anyone who has worked with dates can tell you, they're a huge pain in the ass. I've created a dedicated class for dealing with them called VaxDate. The CDC has stated how they expect for dates to be processed, I've reproduced this below.

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <table border="1">
        <caption>TABLE 3-6 GENERAL DATE RULES</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>Business Rule</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>When adding only years, <br> month and days stay constant</td>
            <td>01/01/2000 + 3 years = 01/01/2003</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>When adding months, <br> day must stay constant</td>
            <td>01/01/2000 + 6 months = 07/01/2000 <br> 11/01/2000 + 6 months = 05/01/2001</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>When adding weeks or days, <br> add that total number of days <br> to the existing date</td>
            <td>01/01/2000 + 3 days = 01/04/2000 <br> 01/01/2000 + 3 weeks = 01/22/2000 <br> 02/01/2000 + 5 weeks = 03/07/2000 (leap year) <br> 02/01/2001 + 5 weeks = 03/08/2001 (not a leap year)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Subtracting days is just subtracting <br> days from the date I've implemented <br> it as just negative addition</td>
            <td>01/15/2000 – 4 days = 01/11/2000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>If the calculated date isn't a real date, <br> it is moved to the first of the next month</td>
            <td>03/31/2000 + 6 months = 10/01/2000 (September 31 does not exist) <br> 08/31/2000 + 6 months = 03/01/2001 (February 31 does not exist)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Date must be calculated by first years, <br> then months, then weeks/days <br> (ToDo: not sure I completely did this)</td>
            <td>01/31/2000 + 6 months – 4 days = 07/27/2000</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>


It's important to note, and it took me a while to catch onto their wording, there are ages and age dates. They are what they say they are, but I struggled with them at first. An age (or an interval) is a string description of a period of time ('4 years', '19 years - 4 days', etc) these are supposed to be added (or subtracted) to a date (usually the DOB, although sometimes the date given of the previous dose). Also, these terms probably won't all make as much sense until you work through it some more.
