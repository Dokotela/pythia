#### Welcome to my implementation guide for Immunization Forecasting. First, a warning:
#### This is not completely FHIR compliant. As part of this was to help myself get more familiar with [FHIR Shorthand (commonly known as FSH)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/), there are some "Resources" I've defined (e.g. [Antigen Supporting Data](StructureDefinition-antigen-supporting-data.html) and [Schedule Supporting Data](StructureDefinition-schedule-supporting-data.html)), that are certainly NOT FHIR. However, they are an accurate representation (at least in JSON) for the data used in the CDC's "CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT FOR IMMUNIZATION (CDSI): LOGIC SPECIFICATION FOR ACIP RECOMMENDATIONS".
